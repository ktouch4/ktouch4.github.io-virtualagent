<p>Customer service virtual agents are AI-powered software programs that interact with customers/ clients, usually via chat or voice, to provide support and resolve any difficulties. They use natural language understanding (NLU) and other AI approaches to converse and fulfill requests, usually automating basic support interactions.</p>

<p>Julie from Amrak serves as one example. Julie is the voice you hear when you call 1-800-USA-RAIL. Amtrak.com has a tool called “Ask Julie” that is designed to guide you navigating that website and lead you to the information you may be looking for. She is well versed in the website’s content and responds to questions in a casual language, allowing you to ask Julie questions in the manner you usually talk. Depending on your question she delivers an accurate answer while directing you to the most relevant webpage, with additional links to web pages that lead to related areas of interest.</p>

<p>A Virtual Assistant can refer to either a human individual providing administrative or technical support remotely or a software bot that automates activities with AI. In this example, it's the ladder.</p>

<p>Siri is Apple's built-in digital assistant that allows users to conduct activities, answer inquiries, and operate their devices via voice or text instructions. Siri has developed since the launch of Apple Intelligence, becoming more context-aware, personal, and capable. Siri is an intelligent personal assistant built into Apple devices such as the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and HomePod. It uses voice recognition and natural language processing to communicate with users, execute orders, and offer information. Siri's understanding of user preferences and speech patterns has improved over time because of machine learning.</p>

<p>Some challenges in the application process of virtual agents include privacy, compliance, algorithmic bias, customer frustration and overreliance. In the case of Amtrak’s Julie it could cause customer frustration if the inquiry is beyond what the virtual agent can answer. In the case of Apple’s Siri, it has been proven to struggle with understanding and recognizing different accents or dialects. Siri has also had slower responses, leading to user frustration. Privacy and security concerns are also another challenge with Siri as it has access to sensitive user data. The situations that call for the use of virtual agents are important and involve customer or user services. In the case of Amtrak’s Julie it is concerned with service for Amtrak’s customers. Apple’s Siri is closer to a personal assistant with it being able to carry out basic and routine tasks for users. Virtual agents may be difficult to use due to the lack of human touch. In the case of customer service-oriented agents that provide voice services it could be challenging for the customer to interact effectively with the AI if it is not properly trained on many scenarios.</p>
