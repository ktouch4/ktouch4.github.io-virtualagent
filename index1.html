<p class="padding-10"> 
With the increased advancement of artificial intelligence, organizations have begun to use virtual agents as a way to communicate with their customers. Virtual agents, as known as virtual assistants, is the combination of natural language processing, intelligent search, and robotic process automation, being able to converse and interact with the user in a coherent manner. They are able to provide assistance, answer questions, and perform other tasks. They usually appear in the form of a chat interface, messaging platform or voice activated devices and are used in several different fields, taking on different tasks.</p>

<p class="padding-10">We chose this technology because our group members recognized that AI is an advanced technology that is being ‘pushed forward’ and has much potential for future developments. We decided to focus specifically on the AI technology of virtual agents since they are easily accessible to use and have recently been a topic of concern in the media.<br><br>
